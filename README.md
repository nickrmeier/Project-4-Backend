# lizt-backend

About:
Lizt is an application for making, sharing, and organizing lists of anything. Users can make and edit their own lists, compile other users lists, search for lists by keyword and send a list as a text to anyone. Think of it as Pinterest but for lists.
Check out the ./planning directory in this repo for information on the ideation and concepts behind this product.

Instructions:
Lizt runs off of 3 servers: the front-end made in React, the back-end database made with Python RESTapi, and the React interface that connects to the Twilio API with Express for texting. At this stage of development texts must be manually copied and pasted into the form in the Twilio interface to be sent.
